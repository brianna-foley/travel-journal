The main area of the city had everything you needed, and you could hop on a bus for a short time to get to a place to enjoy nature.  Ganhyeon is a tourist site with a suspension bridge, swimming areas, and restaurants.  It is a great place to be when the weather is nice, or even too hot.",

I took a trip with a group, which made it easily accessible.  There are plenty of trails to hike, a skyrail to ride to take in the wonderful views without the effort, and I had a delicous dotorimok, which is a salad with acorn jelly, apples and a spicy dressing.",
